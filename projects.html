        <p class="fl w-100">On May 26th, 2018, Peer-to-Peer Web NYC will be hosting an afternoon of talks and workshops at SFPC on the west-side. Peer-to-Peer Web is a broader series of free events that caters to those new to the decentralised web, and are curious in exploring the possibilities that lie beyond a centralised internet controlled by platform monopolies. While p2p networks are technical in nature, we aim to make our programme accessible to participants who do not come from a background in writing software, or building networks themselves. We encourage writers, artists, activists, researchers and general users of the internet to come and hang with us. We also enforce a Code of Conduct at all of our events, which you can read about here.</p>

          This is the first event in NYC and extends the Peer-to-Peer series to a third city. In order for our event to run smoothly, weâ€™re looking for organisations who would like to sponsor us and help cover one of our several costs:
          <ul>
            <li>Refreshments ($150)</li>
            <li>Honoraria ($300)</li>
            <li>Materials ($100)(filled)</li>          
          </ul>
